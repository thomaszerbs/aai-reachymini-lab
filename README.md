# Reachy Mini — Local AI Robot Lab

A **~10 minute hands-on lab** that takes a Reachy Mini desktop robot from a
cloud voice → 100% offline on local hardware → one that **sees and answers
questions** through its own camera. Everything runs on-device via Ollama — no
cloud at the finish line (except Task 1's voice, on purpose).

**What you'll build across three tasks:**

1. **`lab/emo_v1.py`** — expressive robot with a **cloud** voice (Edge-TTS)
2. **`lab/emo_v2.py`** — same robot, **100% offline** (Piper-TTS + local LLM), snappier
3. **`lab/emo_v3.py`** — Reachy gets **eyes**: a local vision model answers your questions about what it sees

The step-by-step guide is **[`lab/LAB.md`](lab/LAB.md)**.

## Hardware

- **[Reachy Mini](https://pollen-robotics.com/reachy-mini/buy/)** robot over USB (`/dev/ttyACM0`), with speaker and camera built-in — pick one up at the [Pollen Robotics store](https://store.pollen-robotics.com)
- Any Linux machine (tested on Ubuntu 24.04 with AMD Strix Halo / Ryzen AI)
- Network for initial setup; Tasks 2 & 3 run fully offline after that

**No physical robot?** The lab also runs with the built-in MuJoCo simulator — pass `--sim` to the daemon (see the [Running](#running) section).

---

## Setup

Two ordered steps: install ROCm **first** (if you have an AMD GPU), then run
`./setup.sh`. Order matters — `setup.sh` starts Ollama, and Ollama only offloads
to the GPU if ROCm is already present.

### Step 0 — Install ROCm (AMD GPU acceleration) — *optional but recommended*

> Skip this entirely if you don't have an AMD GPU or just want to get started.
> The lab runs fine CPU-only — Ollama falls back automatically. Task 3's vision
> model is noticeably slower without GPU acceleration, but everything works.

Follow **[`install-rocm.md`](install-rocm.md)** for the full instructions. Short
version for AMD Strix Halo / Ryzen AI machines (Ubuntu 24.04):

```bash
# 1) OEM kernel, then REBOOT
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y linux-oem-24.04c
sudo reboot

# 2) AMD driver + ROCm, then REBOOT
wget https://repo.radeon.com/amdgpu-install/7.2/ubuntu/noble/amdgpu-install_7.2.70200-1_all.deb
sudo apt install -y ./amdgpu-install_7.2.70200-1_all.deb
amdgpu-install -y --usecase=rocm --no-dkms
sudo usermod -a -G render,video $LOGNAME
sudo reboot

# 3) Verify
rocminfo | grep gfx          # expect gfx1151 on Strix Halo
```

### Step 1 — Run `./setup.sh`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thomaszerbs/aai-reachymini-lab.git
cd aai-reachymini-lab
./setup.sh
```

`setup.sh` is idempotent (safe to re-run). Use `--help` for options, or
`--skip-models` to skip the slow Ollama model pulls on re-runs.

**What it does:**
1. `apt` installs system packages (Python, audio, camera/GStreamer stack)
2. Creates `venv/` and installs `requirements.txt` + `reachy-mini[mujoco]`
3. Installs Ollama and pulls the chat LLM (`qwen3.5:0.8b`) and vision model (`qwen2.5vl:3b`)
4. Verifies the committed Piper voice in `models/`
5. Pre-caches the Task 1 moves library (set `HF_TOKEN` first — see below)
6. Checks ROCm is detected (does **not** install it)
7. Snapshots lab files into `.lab-baseline/` for `./reset.sh`

### Notes

- **Piper voice is committed** in [`models/`](models/) — no download on a normal
  clone. Add voices by dropping `.onnx` + matching `.onnx.json` files from
  [Piper Voices](https://huggingface.co/rhasspy/piper-voices) into `models/`.
- **Moves library** (Task 1 recorded animations) needs a Hugging Face token:
  ```bash
  export HF_TOKEN=<your token>
  ./setup.sh
  ```
- **Vision task** reads the camera directly via V4L2/`ffmpeg`, bypassing the
  daemon's media server. Start the daemon with **`--no-media`** or Task 3 will
  fail with `Device or resource busy`. The Arducam is auto-detected by name;
  override with `--camera-device /dev/videoN` (`v4l2-ctl --list-devices` lists
  them). Live preview is browser-based (`--preview-web`, `http://localhost:8080`).
- **GPU check:** once ROCm is installed, verify Ollama is using it:
  ```bash
  ollama ps    # after a query: PROCESSOR should read "100% GPU"
  ```

---

## Running

Use **two terminals**.

**Terminal A — start the daemon (leave running):**

No physical robot:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
export PYGLFW_LIBRARY_VARIANT=x11   # required on X11 / Xwayland
reachy-mini-daemon --sim            # opens a MuJoCo 3D window
```

With a physical robot:
```bash
# One-time: grant serial port access
sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER && newgrp dialout

source venv/bin/activate
reachy-mini-daemon --no-media       # --no-media frees the camera for Task 3
```

**Terminal B — open the notebook:**

```bash
source venv/bin/activate && jupyter lab
```

Open **[`lab/lab.ipynb`](lab/lab.ipynb)**, pick the **venv kernel**, and run the
**Setup** cell. Follow **[`lab/LAB.md`](lab/LAB.md)** from there.

> **Task 3 with the simulator:** the MuJoCo sim has no camera, so use a webcam:
> `python lab/emo_v3.py --preview-web --camera-device /dev/video0`
> (run `v4l2-ctl --list-devices` to find your device).


### Fallback: terminal scripts

If Jupyter has trouble, the same three tasks run as scripts:

```bash
python lab/emo_v1.py --chat          # Task 1 (cloud voice)
python lab/emo_v2.py --chat          # Task 2 (100% offline)
python lab/emo_v3.py --preview-web   # Task 3 (vision; http://localhost:8080)
```

### Audio / volume

Open **Settings → Sound**, pick the Reachy Mini speaker as Output Device and set
the volume. Or use `alsamixer` in a terminal (F6 to select the device).

---

## Reset

To restore a clean slate (clears notebook outputs, resets edited lab files):

```bash
./reset.sh
```

Then in JupyterLab: **File → Reload Notebook from Disk** and re-run the Setup
cell. Use `./reset.sh --recapture` to make the current state the new baseline.
