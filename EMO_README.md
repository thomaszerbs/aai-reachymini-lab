## emo_v1 — High-Intensity Emotion Engine

Summary
- Purpose: Baseline high-intensity emotion controller and interactive chat app.
- Key features: high-intensity defaults, large-amplitude motion mappings, simple keyword-based emotion classification, quick test harness.

Code snapshot
```python
# emo_v1: basic analysis
text_lower = text.lower()
if any(w in text_lower for w in ["跳舞", "舞蹈"]):
    emotion = "activity"
controller.perform_high_amplitude_action(emotion)
```

---

## emo_v2 — Recorded Moves Integration

Summary
- Purpose: Use `RecordedMoves` for a richer motion vocabulary and categorize moves by emotion.

Code snapshot
```python
# emo_v2 categorize recorded moves
all_moves = self.recorded_moves.list_moves()
for move_name in all_moves:
    move = self.recorded_moves.get(move_name)
    desc = move.description.lower() if move.description else ""
    # assign best_match
```

---

## emo_v3 — Parallel Actions During Streaming

Summary
- Purpose: Trigger actions early while Ollama streams the response for better responsiveness.

Code snapshot
```python
# emo_v3 pseudo
for line in response.iter_lines():
    if 'response' in chunk:
        if should_trigger_now(partial):
            start_background_move()
```

---

## emo_v4 — Reliable Offline TTS (espeak) + Lip-sync

Summary
- Purpose: Add deterministic offline TTS using `espeak` and add lip-sync (antenna/eye animation).

Code snapshot (espeak synth)
```python
cmd = ['espeak', '--stdout', text]
result = subprocess.run(cmd, capture_output=True, check=True)
with open(output_file, 'wb') as f:
    f.write(result.stdout)
```

---

## emo_v5 — High-Quality Edge-TTS with Correct Playback

Summary
- Purpose: Use Edge-TTS to create higher-quality, multilingual speech. Save to WAV, read with `soundfile` and play using `sounddevice` at the file's sample rate to avoid noise.

Code snapshot
```python
# emo_v5
await edge_tts.Communicate(text, voice).save(tmp_path)
data, sr = sf.read(tmp_path, dtype='float32')
sd.play(data, samplerate=sr)
sd.wait()
```

---

## emo_v6 — Continuous Synchronized Actions + Cute Cartoon Voices + Integrated Testing

Summary
- Purpose: Major enhancement with continuous emotional actions throughout speech, synchronized eye blinking + body yaw + head poses, and cute cartoon voices. Features 4-5 action sequences per emotion for maximum expressiveness. Includes integrated testing tools with command-line options for comprehensive validation.

Key Features:
- **Integrated Testing**: `--test-actions` and `--test-tts` command-line options
- **Merged Functionality**: test_combined_actions.py functionality integrated into main script
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Detailed action names in test logs
- **Removed Broken Features**: --test-compat option removed due to compatibility issues

Code snapshot
```python
# emo_v6 combined actions with integrated testing
def _combined_nod_blink(self):
    # Eye blink + head nod synchronization
    if hasattr(self.reachy, 'head'):
        self.reachy.head.r_eye.goal_position = 0.1
    self.reachy.goto_target(head=create_head_pose(pitch=20), duration=0.25)
    # ... full synchronization sequence

# Integrated testing with descriptive action names
def test_combined_actions(self):
    action_name = action.__name__.replace('_combined_', '').replace('_', ' ').title()
    print(f"  {i}. Performing {action_name}...")
```

## emo_v7 — ASR → LLM → TTS (faster-whisper CPU)

Summary
- Purpose: Add a microphone-first pipeline so users can speak directly to Reachy Mini: ASR (faster-whisper on CPU) → Ollama LLM → Edge-TTS + emotion-driven actions.

What you'll find
- Push-to-talk ASR mode implemented with `faster-whisper` (CPU) in `emo_v7.py`.
- Integration with `EmotionControllerV6` so transcribed text is analyzed for emotion and triggers recorded moves / lip-sync during TTS.
- Simple 4s push-to-talk recording by default; documented suggestions for VAD/whisper.cpp fallbacks.

Requirements
- `faster-whisper`, `sounddevice`, and `soundfile` installed in your environment for ASR recording and transcription.

Quick test
```bash
# ASR push-to-talk mode
python emo_v7.py --asr

# Text chat mode
python emo_v7.py
```

Notes
- The ASR mode uses CPU `faster-whisper` by default (`model='small'` recommended). Replace with `whisper.cpp` or VOSK for different latency/accuracy tradeoffs.
- Consider adding VAD (`webrtcvad`) later to automatically detect end-of-speech instead of fixed-length recording.

## emo_v7_vad — VAD-Enhanced ASR Variant

Summary
- Purpose: Experimental variant of `emo_v7.py` that adds Voice Activity Detection (VAD) using `webrtcvad` to automatically stop recording when speech ends, instead of fixed 4s clips.

What you'll find
- `--asr` flag uses VAD-based recording by default (stops on silence).
- `--vad-silence` and `--vad-aggressive` flags to tune VAD behavior.
- Same emotion controller and Edge-TTS pipeline as `emo_v7.py`.

Requirements
- `faster-whisper`, `sounddevice`, `soundfile`, and `webrtcvad-wheels` installed.

Quick test
```bash
# VAD ASR mode (auto-stop when you finish speaking)
python emo_v7_vad.py --asr

# Text chat mode
python emo_v7_vad.py --chat
```

Notes
- VAD aggressiveness ranges from 0 (least aggressive) to 3 (most aggressive); default is 1.
- If VAD is not installed, the script falls back to fixed 4s recording.
- This variant shares the same robustness improvements as v7/v8: lazy imports, EOF protection, dependency checks, and default `--help`.

## emo_v8 — ASR/Text → Ollama → Piper-TTS (Offline)

Summary
- Purpose: replace Edge-TTS with Piper-TTS in the chat pipeline for offline speech synthesis.

What you'll find
- `emo_v8.py` supports both text input and `--asr` microphone mode.
- LLM is still served by Ollama (`--model`), while speech output uses Piper voice models (`--piper-model`).

Requirements
- New dependency:
  - `piper-tts>=1.4.0` (already added in `requirements.txt`)

Piper model download
- Download `.onnx` + `.onnx.json` from:
  - `https://github.com/rhasspy/piper/releases/tag/v0.0.2`
  - `https://huggingface.co/rhasspy/piper-voices`
- Put models into `models/` or pass full path via CLI.

Quick test
```bash
# Text chat
python emo_v8.py --model qwen3.5:0.8b --piper-model models/zh_CN-huayan-medium.onnx

# ASR mode
python emo_v8.py --asr --model qwen3.5:0.8b --piper-model models/zh_CN-huayan-medium.onnx
```


## Migration & CLI notes
- Use `controller.execute_emotion_move()` to move from v1→v2 style.
- `emo_v3` introduces streaming hooks; prefer `_get_ollama_response_parallel`.
- `emo_v4` and `emo_v5` add TTS: use `--test-tts` to validate.
- `emo_v6` integrates testing tools: use `--test-actions` for combined action testing, `--test-tts` for Edge-TTS validation.
- `emo_v6` removed `--test-compat` option due to compatibility issues.

---

## Tests
- All `emo_v*.py` scripts and `utils/*.py` tools now support `--help` and use lazy imports: they will print help even when optional dependencies are missing, and perform a runtime dependency check before entering chat/test modes.
- `utils/test_actions.py` validates both dances and emotions recorded-move libraries (limited to a small set by default). Displays a friendly error if `reachy-mini` is not installed.
- `python emo_v4.py --test-tts` validates local `espeak` integration.
- `python emo_v5.py --test-tts` validates Edge-TTS (requires network).
- `python emo_v6.py --test-actions` validates v6 synchronized eye blinking + body yaw + head + antennas (integrated testing).
- `python emo_v6.py --test-tts` validates Edge-TTS with emotion analysis and cartoon voices.
- `python utils/test_edge_tts_voices.py` discovers and tests cute voices from Edge-TTS library.
- `python utils/test_ollama_connection.py --url <url>` tests HTTP API, OpenAI SDK, and streaming connectivity to Ollama.
- `python utils/test_emotion_analysis.py` runs a non-interactive demo by default; use `--interactive` for manual testing.
- `python utils/latency_harness.py` measures fixed vs VAD recording + ASR timings (requires `faster-whisper` and microphone).
- Note: `utils/test_*.py` scripts are utility demos and environment checks; they are not intended as automated pytest unit tests.
