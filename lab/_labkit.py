"""_labkit — the mini-lab's plumbing, hidden from attendees.

The `lab/lab.ipynb` notebook is meant to show attendees ONLY the task cells and
the editable `# >>> TRY ME <<<` knobs. All the setup noise (imports, sys.path
juggling, Ollama streaming, robot connect/shutdown, the ipywidgets chat bar,
camera capture) lives here so the notebook stays clean:

    from _labkit import *
    connect()

Shared mutable state (the connected robot + the two controllers) lives on a
single `state` singleton. `from _labkit import *` cannot write module globals
back from a notebook cell (name binding rebinds the notebook's own name, not the
module's), so instead the notebook NEVER touches these directly: it calls the
lazy helpers (`get_controller_v1`, `get_controller_offline`, `look_and_describe`)
which read/write `state`, keeping the module and the notebook on the SAME object.
