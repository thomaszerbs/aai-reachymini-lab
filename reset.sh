#!/usr/bin/env bash
# reset.sh — restore the lab to a clean slate between attendees (or re-capture the
# pristine baseline after an intentional lab edit).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: attendees edit the `# >>> TRY ME <<<` cells (notebook) and the
# fallback scripts. A button/cell running INSIDE the notebook can only reset the
# Python *variables* (see the "Reset to defaults" cell) — it CANNOT rewrite the
# visible edited cell text or clear outputs, because the kernel doesn't own the
# document. So the only true "clean slate" is restoring the files themselves,
# which is what this operator-run script does. (lab/lab.ipynb is NOT tracked by
# git, so there's no `git checkout` to fall back on — this snapshot IS the golden
# copy.)
#
# WHAT IT DOES:
#   Default (RESTORE): copies every attendee-editable lab file back from the
#     pristine snapshot in .lab-baseline/ (captured by setup.sh step 7 or by
#     `./reset.sh --recapture`), re-normalizes lab.ipynb (clear outputs +
#     validate), and clears stray Jupyter checkpoints.
#   --recapture (CAPTURE): re-snapshots the CURRENT lab files INTO .lab-baseline/
#     (overwriting). Use this once, after an intentional edit to a lab file, to
#     make the edited version the new golden copy.
#
# Keep LAB_FILES below in sync with snapshot_lab_baseline() in setup.sh.
#
# USAGE (from anywhere):
#   ./reset.sh              # restore the lab files to the pristine baseline
#   ./reset.sh --recapture  # overwrite the baseline with the CURRENT lab files
#   ./reset.sh --help       # show help
#
# After a RESTORE, in JupyterLab: File → Reload Notebook from Disk (or reopen the
# tab), and re-run the Setup cell.

Usage: ./reset.sh [OPTIONS]

Restore the mini-lab to a clean slate between attendees, or re-capture the
pristine baseline after an intentional lab edit. Runs from any CWD (it cd's to
its own directory).

Options:
  (no flag)          RESTORE: copy each lab file back from .lab-baseline/,
                     re-normalize lab.ipynb (clear outputs + validate), and clear
                     Jupyter checkpoints. Use this between attendees.
  --recapture        CAPTURE: re-snapshot the CURRENT lab files INTO
                     .lab-baseline/ (overwriting). Run this once after an
                     intentional edit so the edited version becomes the new
                     golden copy. (Alias: --capture.)
  -h, --help         Show this help and exit.
